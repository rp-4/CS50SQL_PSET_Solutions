Passengers

    When it comes to our passengers, we just need to have the essentials in line: the first name, last name, and age. That’s all we need to know—nothing more.

Check-Ins

    When passengers arrive at ATL, they’ll often “check in” to their flights. That’s them telling us they’re here and all set to board. We’d like to keep a tidy log of such moments. And what would we need to log, you ask? Well, here’s what we need:

        The exact date and time at which our passenger checked in
        The flight they are checking in for, of course. Can’t lose track of where they’re headed, now can we?

Airlines

    ATL’s a hub for many domestic and international airlines: names like Delta, British Airways, Air France, Korean Air, and Turkish Airlines. The list goes on. So here’s what we track:

        The name of the airline
        The “concourse” or, shall I say, the section of our airport where the airline operates. We have 7 concourses: A, B, C, D, E, F, and T.

Flights

    We serve as many as 1,000 flights daily. To ensure that our passengers are never left wondering, we need to give them all the critical details about their flight. Here’s what we’d like to store:

        The flight number. For example, “900”. Just know that we sometimes re-use flight numbers.
        The airline operating the flight. You can keep it simple and assume one flight is operated by one airline.
        The code of the airport they’re departing from. For example, “ATL” or “BOS”.
        The code of the airport they’re heading to
        The expected departure date and time (to the minute, of course!)
        The expected arrival date and time, to the very same accuracy

**Ingredients**
- We certainly need to keep track of our ingredients.
- flour,
- yeast,
- oil,
- butter,
- several different types of sugar.
- keep track of the price we pay per unit of ingredient (whether it’s pounds, grams, etc.).

**Donuts**
- The name of the donut
- Whether the donut is gluten-free
- The price per donut
- Oh, and it’s important that we be able to look up the ingredients for each of the donuts!

**Orders**
- An order number, to keep track of each order internally
- All the donuts in the order
- The customer who placed the order. We suppose we could assume only one customer places any given order.

**Customers**
- A customer’s first and last name
- A history of their orders
